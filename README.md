# Flutter Notes

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/FerMod/flutter_notes?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/FerMod/flutter_notes/releases)

## Getting Started

First of all, you will need to have to setup the flutter environment to build and run this project.
You can follow the official [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) guide to set up all properly.

### Installing

Clone the project with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FerMod/flutter_notes.git
```

Next is to install the required packages and auto generated files.
In the project root folder, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Without running the last command, the first time that is loaded the project in an editor, there will be showing errors.
Most of them are because the project is missing auto generated files.

## Running the tests

The Flutter SDK can run unit tests and widget tests in a virtual machine, without the need of a physical device or emulator. 
To run the tests, first navigate to the project's root folder.

To run all the test files in the `test/` directory run:

```bash
flutter test
```

If you want to run a particular test file, run:

```bash
flutter test test/<file_path>
```
